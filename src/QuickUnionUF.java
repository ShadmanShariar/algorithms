/*
Quick Union is an algorithm to solve dynamic connectivity problem.
An integer array of length N, where interpretation is that array[i] is the parent of i. Or root of i is arr[arr[..arr[i]]]
It stores the tree structure in array, by storing parent of each.

Complexity:
 Initialize: N
 Union: N (cost in finding roots)
 Find: N

Defect is that trees can get tall, which is expensive
